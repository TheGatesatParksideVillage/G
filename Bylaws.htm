<p>Section 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Applicability. </u></b>These Bylaws provide for the self-government of The Gates at 
Parkside Village Townhome Association, Inc., in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation filed with the 
Secretary of State and the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions and Easements for The Gates at 
Parkside Village, recorded in the Cobb County, Georgia land records ("Declaration"). 

<p>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Name.</u></b> The name of the corporation is The Gates at Parkside Village Townhome 
Association, Inc. ("Association"). 

<p>Section 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Definitions. </u></b>The terms used herein shall have their accepted meanings or 
such meanings as are specified in the Declaration. 

<p>Section 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Membership. </u></b>An Owner of a Lot shall automatically become a member of the 
Association upon taking title to the Lot and shall remain a member for the entire period of ownership. As 
may be more fully provided below, a spouse or cohabitant of a member may exercise the powers and 
privileges of the member. If title to a Lot is held by more than one (1) Person, the membership shall be 
shared in the same proportion as the title, but there shall be only one (1) membership and one (1)vote per 
Lot. Membership does not include Persons who hold an interest merely as security for the performance of an 
obligation, and the giving of a security interest shall not terminate the Owner's membership. Membership 
shall be appurtenant to the Lot and shall be Transferred automatically by conveyance of that Lot and may be 
transferred only in connection with the transfer of title. 

<p>Section 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Entity Members. </u></b>In the event an Owner is a corporation, limited liability company, 
partnership, trust, or other legal entity not being a natural person or persons, then any natural person who is 
an officer, director, or other designated agent of such corporation, partner of such partnership, beneficiary or 
other designated agent of such trust, or manager of a limited liability company or representative of such other 
legal entity shall be eligible to represent such entity or entities in the affairs of the Association. Such person's 
relationship with the Association shall terminate automatically upon the termination of such person's 
relationship with the entity or entities which are the Owner, and termination of the person's relationship with 
the Association will create a vacancy in any elected or appointed position within the Association in which 
such person may have been serving and such vacancy will be filled in accordance with these Bylaws. 

<p>Section 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Voting. </u></b>Each Lot shall be entitled to one (1) equally weighted vote, which vote may 
be cast by the Owner, the Owner's spouse, the cohabitant of the Owner or by a lawful proxy as provided 
below When more than one (1) Person owns a Lot, the vote for such Lot shall be exercised as they 
determine between or among themselves, but in no event shall more than one (1)vote be cast with respect to 
any Lot. If only one (1) co-owner attempts to cast the vote for a Lot, it shall be conclusively presumed that 
such co-owner is authorized on behalf of all co-owners to cast the vote for such Lot. In the event of 
disagreement between or among co-owners and an attempt by two (2) or more of them to cast such vote or 
votes, such Persons shall not be recognized and such vote or votes shall not be counted. No Owner shall be 
eligible to vote, either in person or by proxy, or to act as proxy for any other member or to be elected to the 

Board of Directors, if that Owner is shown on the books or management accounts of the Association to be 

--more than thirty (30) days delinquent in any payment due the Association or if the Owner has had its voting 

rights suspended for the infraction of any provision of the Declaration, these Bylaws, or any rule of the 

Association. If the voting rights of an Owner have been suspended, that Owner shall not be counted as an 
eligible vote for purposes of establishing a Majority or a quorum. 


<p><center><h1>-1-</h1></center></p>


<p>Section 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Majority. </u></b>As used in these Bylaws, the term "majority" shall mean those votes, 
Owners, or other group as the context may indicate totaling more than fifty percent (50%) of the total number 
of eligible votes, Owners, or other group, respectively. Unless otherwise specifically stated, the words 
"majority vote" mean more than fifty percent (50%) of those voting in person or by proxy. Except as 
otherwise specifically provided in the Declaration or these Bylaws, all decisions shall be by majority vote. 

<p>Section 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Purpose. </u></b>The Association shall have the responsibility of administering the 
Community, establishing the means and methods of collecting the contributions to the Common Expenses, 
arranging for the management of the Community and performing all of the other acts that may be required to 
be performed by the Association pursuant to the Georgia Nonprofit Corporation Code and the Declaration. 
Except as to those matters which the Declaration or the Georgia Nonprofit Corporation Code specifically 
require to be performed by the vote of the Association membership, the administration of the foregoing 
responsibilities shall be performed by the Board of Directors as more particularly set forth below. 

<p>Section 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Electronic Documents and Signatures. </u></b>
<ol type= "a">
<p><li>Documents. Whenever these Bylaws require that a document, record or instrument be 
"written" or "in writing," the requirement is deemed satisfied by an Electronic Document. "Electronic 
Document" means information created, transmitted, received, or stored by electronic means and 
retrievable in human perceivable form, such as email, web pages, electronic documents, facsimile 
transmissions, etc. Records, documents and instruments shall not be denied effect or validity solely on 
the grounds that they are electronic. 
<p><li>Signatures. Whenever these Bylaws require a signature, an electronic signature satisfies 
that requirement only if: (1) the signature is easily recognizable as a Secure Electronic Signature which is 
capable of verification, under the sole control of the signatory, and attached to the electronic document in 
such a way that the document cannot be modified without invalidating the signature; or (2) the Board 
reasonably believes that the signatory affixed the signature with the intent to sign the Electronic 
Document, and that the Electronic Document has not been modified since the signature was affixed. 
<p><li> Verification and Liability for Falsification. The Board may require reasonable verification 
of any electronic signature, document, record or instrument. Pending verification, the Board may refuse 
to accept any electronic signature, document, record or instrument that, in the Board's sole discretion, is 
not clearly authentic. Neither the Board nor the Association shall be liable to any Member or any other 
Person for accepting or acting in reliance upon an electronic signature or Electronic Document which the 
Board reasonably believes to be authentic. Any Member or Person who negligently, recklessly or 
intentionally submits any falsified Electronic Document or unauthorized electronic signature shall fully 
indemnify the Association for actual damages, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred as a 
result of such acts.

<P><h2><u>Meetings of Members</u> </h2></center></p></a>

<center><a href= "#home"><font face= "times">Table of Contents</font></a></center>

<p>Section 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b> Annual Meetings. </u></b>Annual meetings of the members shall be set by the Board so as 
to ocur during the last quarter of the year, with the date, hour, and place to be set by the Board of Directors. 

No first meeting or annual meeting of the Association shall be set on a legal holiday. 



<p>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Special Meetings. </u></b>Special meetings of the members may be called for any purpose 
at any time by the President, the Secretary, or by request of any two (2) or more members of the Board of 
Directors, or upon written petition of Owners holding a least twenty-five percent (25%) of the Total 
Association Vote. Any such written petition by the members must be submitted to the Association's 
Secretary. The Secretary shall then verify that the required number of members have joined in the petition 
and shall submit all proper petitions to the Association's President. The President shall then promptly call a 
special meeting for the purpose stated in the petition setting the date, time and location of the meeting (which 
is not required to be the date, time or location requested in any petition submitted to the Association), and the 
Secretary shall send notice of the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws. Any special meeting called 
pursuant to written petition shall be set within thirty (30) days of the date of the petition. 

<p>Section 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Notice of Meeting. </u></b>It shall be the duty of the Secretary to mail or deliver to each 
Owner of a Lot of record or to the Lot a notice of each annual or special meeting of the Association at least 
twenty-one (21) days prior to each annual meeting and at least seven (7) days prior to each special meeting. 
The notice of an annual meeting shall state the time and place of the meeting. The notice of a special meeting 
shall state the purpose of any special meeting, as well as the time and place where it is to be held. If any 
Owner wishes notice to be given at an address other than his or her Lot, the Owner shall have designated by 
notice in writing to the Secretary such other address. The mailing or delivering of a notice of meeting in the 
manner provided in this Section shall be considered proper service of notice. 

<p>Section 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Waiver of Notice. </u></b>Waiver of notice of meeting of the Owners shall be deemed the 
equivalent of proper notice. Any Owner may, in writing, waive notice of any meeting of the Owners, either 
before or after such meeting. Attendance at a meeting by an Owner, whether in person or represented by 
proxy, shall be deemed waiver by such Owner of notice of the time, date, and place thereof unless such 
Owner specifically objects to lack of proper notice at the time the meeting is called to order. Attendance at a 
special meeting shall also be deemed waiver of notice of all business transacted at such meeting unless 
objection to lack of notice is raised before the business, of which proper notice was not given, is put to a vote. 

<p>Section 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Quorum.</u></b> Except as may be provided elsewhere, the presence of Owners, in person or by proxy at the beginning of the meeting, entitled to cast one third (1/3) of the Total Association Vote shall 
constitute a quorum. Once a quorum is established for a meeting, it shall conclusively be presumed to exist 
until the meeting is adjourned and shall not need to be reestablished. Owners whose voting rights have been 
suspended pursuant to the Declaration or these Bylaws shall not be counted as eligible votes toward the 
quorum requirement. 

<p>Section 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Adjournment. </u></b>Any meeting of the Owners may be adjourned from time to time for 
periods not exceeding thirty (30) days by vote of the Owners holding the Majority of the votes represented at 
such meeting, regardless of whether a quorum is present. Any business which could be transacted properly at 
the original session of the meeting may be transacted at a reconvened session, and no additional notice of 
such reconvened session shall be required. 

<p>Section 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Proxy. </u></b>Any member entitled to vote may do so by written proxy duly executed by 
the member setting forth the meeting at which the proxy is valid. To be valid, a proxy must be signed, dated, 
and filed with the Secretary prior to the opening of the meeting for which it is to be used. Proxies may be 
delivered to the Board by personal delivery, U.S. mail or facsimile transmission to any Board member or the 
property manager. Proxies may be revoked only by written notice delivered to the Secretary of the 
Association, except that: (a) the presence in person by the giver of a proxy at a meeting for which the proxy 
is given shall automatically invalidate the proxy for that meeting; and (b) a later dated proxy shall 
i" automatically be deemed to invalidate any previously given proxy. A proxy holder may not appoint a 
substitute proxy holder unless expressly authorized to do so in the proxy. 

<p><center><h1>-3-</h1></center></p>


<p>Section 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Action Without a Meeting. </u></b>In the Board's discretion, any action that may be taken 

by the Association members at any annual, regular, or special meeting may be taken without a meeting if the 
Board delivers a written consent form or written ballot to every member entitled to vote on the matter. 
<ol type= "a">

<p><li> Ballot. A written ballot shall set forth each proposed action and provide an opportunity to 
vote for or against each proposed action. Approval by written ballot shall be valid only when the number of 
votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, 
and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve the 
matter at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by 
ballot. 
All solicitations for votes by written ballot shall: (1) indicate the number of responses needed to 
meet the quorum requirements; (2) state the percentage of approvals necessary to approve each matter other 
than election of directors; and (3) specify the time by which a ballot must be received by the Board in order 
to be counted. A written ballot may not be revoked. The Association shall maintain such ballots in its file 
for at least three (3) years. 
<p><li> Written Consent. Approval by written consent shall be valid only when the number of 
written consents setting forth the actions taken is received and equals or exceeds the requisite majority of the 
voting power required to pass such action at a meeting held on the date that the last consent is executed and 
such action is consented to by the Declarant, if required. Executed written consents shall be included in the 
minutes or filed with the Association's records. If an action of the members is approved by written consent 
hereunder, the Board shall issue written notice of such approval to all members who did not sign written 
consents. Membership approval shall be effective ten (10) days after written notice is issued; provided, 
however, if the consent is to an amendment to the Declaration or Bylaws which must be recorded, the 
(e j effective date shall be no earlier than the date of recording of such amendment. 
</ol>
<p>Section 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Order of Business.</u></b> At all meetings of the Association, Roberts Rules of Order 
(latest edition) shall govern when not in conflict with the Declaration, these Bylaws or the Articles of 
Incorporation, unless the Owners present at a particular meeting a vote to suspend Roberts Rules at that 
meeting.

<P><h2><u>Board of Directors</u> </h2></center></p></a>

<center><a href= "#home"><font face= "times">Table of Contents</font></a></center>

<ol type= "A">

<p><li>  Composition and Selection. 

<p>Section 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Governing Body; Composition. </u></b>The affairs of the Association shall be governed by 
a Board of Directors. Except as provided in Section 2 of this Article, the directors shall be members or 
spouses or cohabitants of such members; provided, however, no Person and his or her spouse or cohabitants 
may serve on the Board at the same time, and no co-owners may serve on the Board at the same time. No 
persons shall be eligible to be elected to or continue to serve on the Board of Directors if they are shown on 
the book and records of the Association to be more than thirty (30) days delinquent in the payment of any 
assessment or charge by the Association. Directors shall not be eligible to serve more than three (3) 
consecutive two (2) year terms without first resigning from the Board for a time period which shall be the 
lesser of: (a) one (1) year; or (b) the period to time from the end of one (1) annual meeting of the Association 
to the beginning of the next annual meeting of the Association. 




<p>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Directors Appointed by Declarant. </u></b>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
herein, Declarant shall have exclusive authority to appoint and remove directors and officers until the earlier 


of: (1) seven (7) years after the recording of the Declaration, (2) the date as of which one hundred percent 
(100%) of the Lots shall have been conveyed by Declarant to Owners other than a Person constituting the 
Declarant unless Declarant at that time has an unexpired option to add Additional Property, or (3) the 
surrender in writing by Declarant of the authority to appoint and remove officers and directors of the 
Association. Each Owner, by acceptance of a deed to or other conveyance of a Lot, vests in Declarant this 
authority to appoint and remove directors and officers of the Association. 

<p><center><h1>-4-</h1></center></p>


<p>Section 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Number of Directors and Term of Office. </u></b>During the Declarant Control Period, 
the Board shall consist of four (4) persons. After termination of the Declarant Control Period, the 
Association shall call a meeting at which Owners shall elect three (3) directors. If such meeting is not the 
annual meeting, the directors elected shall serve until the next annual meeting. At the first annual 
meeting after Declarant has surrendered control of the Association, the two (2) directors receiving the 
highest number of votes shall be elected for terms of two (2) years each and the remaining director shall 
be elected for a term of one (1) year. At each annual meeting thereafter, a successor shall be elected to 
serve for a term of two (2) years. The members of the Board of Directors shall hold office until their 
respective successors shall have been elected by the Association. 

<p> Section 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Nomination. </u></b>Nomination for election to the Board shall be made from the floor at 
the meeting. The Board also may appoint a nominating committee to make nominations prior to the 
meeting. 

<p>Section 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Elections. </u></b>All members of the Association eligible to vote shall be entitled to cast 
their entire vote for each directorship to be filled. There shall be no cumulative voting. The directorships 
for which elections are held shall be filled by that number of candidates receiving the most votes. Voting 
for election of Board members shall be by written ballot (unless dispensed by unanimous consent at such 
meeting at which such voting is conducted). 

<p>Section 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Removal of Members of the Board of Directors. </u></b>After expiration of the Declarant 
Control Period, at any regular or special meeting of the Association duly called, any one (1) or more of the 
members of the Board of Directors may be removed with or without cause by a Majority of the Total 
Association Vote and a successor may then and there be elected to fill the vacancy thus created. Further, any 
director who is more than thirty (30) days past due in payment of any assessment or charge shall be 
automatically removed from the Board of Directors, even if the director subsequently pays the amount owed, 
and the vacancy shall be filed as provided in Section 5 below. Any director who has had three (3) 
consecutive unexcused absences from regularly scheduled Board meetings may be removed by the vote of a 
Majority of the other directors. Any director whose removal has been proposed shall be given at least ten 
(10) days notice of the calling of the meeting to consider his or her removal and the purpose thereof and shall 
be given an opportunity to be heard at the meeting. 

<p>Section 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Vacancies. </u></b>Vacancies in the Board of Directors caused by any reason, except the 
removal of a director by vote of the membership, shall be filled by a vote of the Majority of the remaining 
directors, even though less than a quorum, at any meeting of the Board of Directors. The successor so 
selected shall hold office until the next annual meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated 
herein, any director who is an officer, director or other designated agent of an entity member and whose

<p>Section 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Authority and Enforcement. </u></b>The Community shall be used only for those uses and 
purposes set out in the Declaration. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to make, modify, repeal 
and enforce reasonable rules and regulations governing the conduct, use, and enjoyment of Lots and the 
Common Property; provided, however, copies of all such rules and regulations shall be furnished to all 
Owners and Occupants. Any rule or regulation may be repealed by the affirmative vote or written consent of 
a Majority of the Total Association Vote at an annual or special meeting of the membership. Every Owner 
and Occupant shall comply with the Declaration, Bylaws and rules and regulations of the Association, and 
any lack of compliance therewith shall entitle the Association and, in an appropriate case, one (1) or more 
aggrieved Lot Owners, to take action to enforce the terms of the Declaration, Bylaws or rules and regulations. 

The Board shall have the power to impose reasonable fines, which shall constitute a lien upon the 
Owner's Lot, and to suspend an Owner's right to vote or to use the Common Property for violation of any 
duty imposed under the Declaration, these Bylaws, or any rules and regulations duly adopted hereunder; 
provided, however, nothing herein shall authorize the Association or the Board of Directors to limit ingress 
and egress to or from a Lot. In the event that any Occupant of a Lot violates the Declaration, Bylaws, or a 
rule or regulation and a fine is imposed, notice of such violation shall be sent to the Owner and the Occupant, 
and the fine shall first be assessed against such Occupant; provided, however, if the fine is not paid by the 
Occupant within the time period set by the Board, the Owner shall pay the fine upon notice from the 
Association, and the fine shall be an assessment and a lien against the Lot until paid. The failure of the Board 
to enforce any provision of the Declaration, Bylaws, or any rule or regulation shall not be deemed a waiver of 
the right of the Board to do so thereafter. 

<p><center><h1>-10-</h1></center></p>


<p>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Fining and Suspension Procedure. </u></b>The Board shall not impose a fine or suspend the 
right to vote or to use the Common Property (unless an Owner is shown on the books or management 
accounts of the Association to be more than thirty (30) days delinquent in any payment due the Association in 
which case such suspensions shall be automatic; provided further, however, suspension of common utility 
services shall require compliance with the provisions of the Declaration, where applicable) unless and until 
notice of the violation is given as provided in subsection 2(a) below. Any such fine or fines may be effective 
or commence upon the sending of such notice or such later date as may be set forth in such notice, 
notwithstanding the violator's right to request a hearing before the Board to challenge such fine under 
subsection 2(b) below. 
<ol type= "a">

(iii) a statement that the violator may challenge the fact of the occurrence of a violation, the proposed 
sanction, or both, by written challenge and written request for a hearing before the Board, which request must 
be received by the Board within ten (10) days of the date of the notice; (iv) the name, address, and telephone 
number of a person to contact to challenge the proposed action. If a timely challenge is made and the 
violation is cured within ten (10) days of the date of the notice, the Board, in its discretion, may, but is not 
obligated to, waive any sanction or portion thereof. In the event of a continuing violation, each day the 
violation continues or occurs again constitutes a separate offense, and fines may be imposed on a per diem 
basis without further notice to the violator. 


<p><li>  Hearing. If the alleged violator timely challenges the proposed action, a hearing before the 
Board of Directors shall be held in executive session affording the violator a reasonable opportunity to be 
heard. The hearing shall be set at a reasonable time and date by the Board, and notice of the time, date 
(which shall be not less than ten (10) days from the giving of notice without the consent of the violator), and 
place of the hearing and an invitation to attend the hearing and produce any statements, evidence, and 
witnesses shall be sent to the alleged violator. Proof of such notice shall be placed in the minutes of the 
meeting. Such proof shall be deemed adequate if a copy of the notice, together with a statement of the date 
and manner of delivery, is entered by the officer or director who delivered such notice. The notice 
requirement shall be deemed satisfied if the violator appears at the meeting. The minutes of the meeting shall 
contain a written statement of the results of the hearing and the sanction, if any, imposed. This Section shall 
be deemed complied with if a hearing is held and the violator attends and is provided an opportunity to be 
heard, notwithstanding the fact that the notice requirements contained herein are not technically followed.

the towing of vehicles that are in violation of parking rules and regulations) or by suit at law or in equity to 
enjoin any violation or to recover monetary damages or both without the necessity for compliance with the 
procedure set forth in Section 2 of this Article. In any such action, to the maximum extent permissible, the 
Owner or Occupant responsible for the violation for which abatement is sought shall pay all costs, including 
reasonable attorney's fees actually incurred. 
The Association or its duly authorized agent shall have the power to enter a Lot or upon any portion 
of the Common Property to abate or remove, using such force as may be reasonably necessary, any structure, 
thing or condition which violates the Declaration, the Bylaws, or the rules and regulations; provided, 
however, written notice shall be given to the Owner of the Lot at least two (2) days prior to the time that any 
items of construction are altered or demolished. All costs of self-help, including reasonable attorney's fees, 
shall be assessed against the violating Owner and shall be collected as provided herein for the collection of 
assessments.
