<h2><u>Assessments </u></h2></center></a>
<center><a href= "#home"><font face= "times">Table of Contents</font></a></center>



<p>Section 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Purpose of Assessment.</U> The assessments provided for herein shall be used for the 
general purposes of promoting the common benefit and enjoyment of the Owners and Occupants of Lots, 
including the maintenance of real and personal property, all as may be more specifically authorized from 
time to time by the Board of Directors. </P>
<p>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Creation of the Lien and Personal Obligation for Assessments. </U>Each Owner of any 
Lot, by acceptance of a deed therefor, whether or not it shall be so expressed in such deed, covenants and 
agrees to pay to the Association (a) annual assessments or charges, (b) special assessments, such 
assessments to be established and collected as hereinafter provided, and (c) specific assessments against any 
particular Lot which are established pursuant to the terms of this Declaration, including, but not limited to, 
reasonable fines as may be imposed in accordance with the terms of this Declaration. All such assessments, 
together with late charges, interest not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by law per annum on the 
principal amount due, and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees actually incurred, 
shall be a charge on the land and shall be a continuing lien upon the Lot against which each assessment is 
made. Each such assessment, together with late charges, interest, costs, including, without limitation, 
reasonable attorney's fees actually incurred, shall also be the personal obligation of the Person who was the 
Owner of such Lot at the time the assessment fell due. Each Owner shall be personally liable for his or her 
portion of each assessment coming due while he or she is the Owner of a Lot, and his or her grantee shall be 
jointly and severally liable for such portion thereof as may be due and payable at the time of conveyance; 
provided. however, the liability of a grantee for the unpaid assessments of its grantor shall not apply to any 
first Mortgagee taking title through foreclosure proceedings or deed in lieu of foreclosure. </P>
<p>The Association shall, within five (5) days after receiving a written request therefore and for a 
reasonable charge, furnish a certificate signed by an officer of the Association setting forth whether the 
assessments on a specified Lot have been paid. A properly executed certificate of the Association as to the 
status of assessments on a Lot shall be biding upon the Association as of the date of issuance. </P>
<p>Annual assessments shall be levied at a uniform rate per Lot and shall be paid in such manner and 
on such dates as may be fixed by the Board of Directors, which may include, without limitation, 
acceleration, upon ten (10) days written notice, of the annual assessment for delinquents. Unless otherwise 
provided by the Board, the assessment shall be paid in annual installments. </P>
<P>Section 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Computation of Annual Assessment. </U>It shall be the duty of the Board to prepare a 
budget covering the estimated costs of operating the Association during the coming year, which may 
include, if necessary, a capital contribution or reserve in accordance with a capital budget separately 
prepared. 

<p><center><h1>-7-</h1></center></P>

<p>The common assessment to be levied against each Lot for the coming year shall be set at a level 
which is reasonably expected to produce total revenue to the Association equal to the total budgeted 
operating costs of the Association. The Board shall cause the proposed budget and assessments to be levied 
against each Lot for the following year to be delivered to each member at least thirty (30) days prior to the 
end of the current fiscal year (or at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of the first installment in the 
case of the initial budget). The budget and the assessment shall become effective unless disapproved at a 
meeting by a Majority of the Total Association Vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the event 
the membership disapproves the proposed budget or the Board fails for any reason so to determine the 
budget for the succeeding year, then and until such time as a budget shall have been determined, as provided 
herein, the budget in effect for the then current year shall continue for the succeeding year. </P>
<P>Section 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Special Assessments. </U>In addition to the other assessments authorized herein, the 
Association may levy special assessments to cover unbudgeted expenses or expenses in excess of those 
budgeted if approved by a Majority of the Total Association Vote. Special assessments shall be paid as 
determined by the Board, and the Board may permit special assessments to be paid in installments extending 
beyond the fiscal year in which the special assessment is imposed. </P>
<P>Section 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Lien for Assessments. </U>All sums assessed against any Lot pursuant to this 
Declaration, together with late charges, interest, costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's 
fees actually incurred, as provided herein, shall be secured by a lien on such Lot in favor of the Association 
and the Association shall be entitled to file such a lien in the land records of Cobb County, Georgia. Such 
lien shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances on such Lot, except for (a) liens for ad valorem 
taxes and (b) liens for all sums unpaid on a first Mortgage or on any Mortgage to Declarant duly recorded in 
the land records of Cobb County, Georgia and all amounts advanced pursuant to such Mortgage and secured 
thereby in accordance with the terms of such instrument. </P>
<P>All other Persons acquiring liens or encumbrances on any Lot after this Declaration shall have been 
recorded in such records shall be deemed to consent that such liens or encumbrances shall be inferior to 
future liens for assessments, as provided herein, whether or not prior consent is specifically set forth in the 
instruments creating such liens or encumbrances. </P>
<P>Section 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Effect of Nonpayment of Assessments:</U> Remedies of the Association. Any 
assessments or installments thereof which are not paid when due shall be delinquent. Any assessment or 
installment thereof delinquent for a period of more than ten (10) days shall incur a late charge in an amount 
as the Board may from time to time determine which shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the 
assessment payment. The Association shall cause a notice of delinquency to be given to any member who 
has not paid within ten (10) days following the due date. If the assessment is not paid within thirty (30) 
days, a lien, as herein provided, shall attach and, in addition, the lien shall include interest not to exceed the 
maximum rate permitted by law per annum on the principal amount due from the date first due and payable, 
all late charges, all costs of collection, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees actually 
incurred, and any other amounts provided or permitted by law. In the event that the assessment remains 
unpaid after sixty (60) days, the Association may, as the Board shall determine, institute suit to collect such 
amounts and/or to foreclose its lien. Each Owner, by acceptance of a deed or as a party to any other type of 
a conveyance, vests in the Association or its agents the right and power to bring all actions against such 
Owner personally for the collection of such charges as a debt or to foreclose the aforesaid lien in the same 
manner as other liens for the improvement of real property. The lien provided for in this Article shall be in 
favor of the Association and shall be for the benefit of all other Owners. The Association, acting on behalf 
of the Owners, shall have the power to bid on the Lot at any foreclosure sale or to acquire, hold, lease, 
mortgage, or convey the same. In addition to the other remedies provided herein, the Association shall have </P>

<p><center><h1>-8-</h1></center></P>

<p>the right to suspend the voting rights of an Owner for any period during which any assessment against such 
Owner's Lot which is hereby provided for remains unpaid. </P>
<p>In the event that any assessment or other charge is delinquent for sixty (60) days and the amount 
owed is in excess of the dollar amount equal to three (3) times the monthly assessment owed by a Lot 
Owner, then, in addition to all other rights provided herein, upon no less than ten (10) days written notice, 
the Association shall have the right to suspend any utility or services to the Lot paid for as a Common 
Expense by the Association. Any costs incurred by the Association in discontinuing and/or reconnecting 
any utility or service, including reasonable attorney's fees, shall be an assessment against the Lot. The 
utility or service shall not be required to be restored until all sums owed the Association are paid in full, at 
which time the Association shall make arrangements for restoration of the utility or service. A Lot Owner 
whose utility or service has been suspended hereunder shall not be entitled to use any such utility or service 
from any source, and any such unauthorized use shall be considered a theft of services under O.C.G.A. 
Section 16-8-5. </P>
<P>No Owner may waive or otherwise exempt himself or herself from liability for the assessments 
provided for herein, including, by way of illustration, but not limitation, abandonment of the Lot. The 
obligation to pay assessments is a separate and independent covenant in the part of each Owner, and no 
diminution or abatement of any assessment shall be claimed or allowed by reason of any alleged failure of 
the Association to take some action or perform some function required to be taken or performed by the 
Association under this Declaration or the Bylaws, or for inconvenience or discomfort arising from the 
making of repairs or improvements which are the responsibility of the Association, or from any action taken 
by the Association to comply with any law, ordinance, or with any order or directive of any municipal or 
other governmental authority. </P>
<P>All payments shall be applied first to costs and attorney's fees, then to late charges, then to interest 
and then to delinquent assessments. </P>
<P>Section 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Date of Commencement of Assessments. </U>Assessments shall commence as to a Lot 
on the first day of the month following the conveyance of the Lot to a Person other than the Declarant. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, the Declarant shall not be responsible for the 
payment of any type of assessment, except that assessments shall commence on Lots containing occupied 
residences (but excluding those Lots containing model homes or a sales center) that are owned by Declarant 
on the first day of the month following the occupancy of the residence located on the Lot. Assessments 
shall be due and payable in a manner and on a schedule as the Board of Directors may provide. The first 
annual common assessment shall be adjusted according to the number of months then remaining in that 
fiscal year. </P>
<p>Section 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Specific Assessments. </U>The Board shall have the power to specifically assess 
pursuant to this Section as, in its discretion, it shall deem appropriate. Failure of the Board to exercise its 
authority under this Section shall not be grounds for any action against the Association or the Board of 
Directors and shall not constitute a waiver of the Board's right to exercise its authority under this Section in 
the future with respect to any expenses, including an expense for which the Board has not previously 
exercised its authority under this Section. Fines levied pursuant to Article V of the Bylaws and the costs of 
maintenance performed by the Association for which the Owner is responsible for under Article XII, 
Sections 1 and 2 of this Declaration shall be specific assessments. The Board may also specifically assess 
Owners for the following Association expenses: </P>

<ol type= "a">
<li> expenses of the Association which benefit less than all of the Lots in the Community may 
be specifically assessed equitably among all of the Lots which are benefited according to the benefit 
received; and </li></P>
<li> expenses of the Association which benefit all Lots, but which do not provide an equal 
benefit to all Lots, may be assessed equitably among all Lots according to the benefit received. </li></P>
</ol>
<p>Section 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Budget Deficits During Declarant Control. </u>During the Declarant Control Period, 
Declarant may, but shall not be required to (a) advance funds to the Association sufficient to satisfy the 
deficit, if any, between the actual operating expenses of the Association (but specifically not including an 
allocation for capital reserves) and the sum of the annual, special and specific assessments collected by the 
Association in any fiscal year, and such advances shall be evidenced by promissory notes from the 
Association in favor of the Declarant, or (b) cause the Association to borrow such amount from a 
commercial lending institution at the then prevailing rates for such a loan in the local area of the 
Community. The Declarant in its sole discretion may guarantee repayment of such loan, if required by the 
lending institution, but no Mortgage secured by the Common Property or any of the improvements 
maintained by the Association shall be given in connection with such loan. </P>

<p>Section 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Initiation Fee. </U>The purchaser of each Lot at the closing of the sale or resale of a 
Lot shall pay to the Association an initiation fee in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500). In the 
event such initiation fee is not paid in accordance with this Section 10, such amount shall be a specific 
assessment against such Lot. The initiation fee shall not be deemed an advance payment of regular or 
special assessments. The Board shall have discretion to increase the initiation fee by resolution of the 
Board; provided, however, the initiation fee shall not be changed by the Board without Declarant’s consent 
during the Declarant Control Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no initiation fee shall 
be due from any Person who takes title through foreclosure (or deed in lieu of foreclosure) upon the lien of 
any first priority Mortgage covering the Lot and the lien of any secondary purchase money Mortgage 
covering the Lot. This initiation fee shall be an assessment, which is the personal obligation of the Owner, 
and shall constitute a lien, which may be collected as provided in this Article. </P>

<p>Section 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Insurance. </u>The Association's Board of Directors or its duly
 authorized agent 
shall have the authority to and shall obtain casualty insurance affording fire and extended coverage 
insurance for all structures in the Community; provided, however, the Association's insurance shall not 
include the Lot Owners' personal property (which shall be the sole responsibility of the Lot Owner). This 
insurance shall cover loss or damage by fire or other hazards, including extended coverage, vandalism 
and malicious mischief and shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the full replacement cost of any 
repair or reconstruction in the event of damage or destruction from any such hazard. Alternatively, the 
Board may purchase "all-risk" coverage in like amounts. 
If available at a reasonable cost, as determined in the sole discretion of the Board, the Board shall 
obtain a public liability policy applicable to the Common Property insuring the Association and its 
members for all damage or injury caused by the negligence of the Association or any of its members or 
agents. The public liability policy shall have a combined single limit of at least One Million Dollars 
($1,000,000.00). If available at a reasonable cost, as determined in the sole discretion of the Board, the 
Board shall also obtain directors' and officers' liability insurance. </P>

<P><CENTER><H1>-10- </H1></CENTER></P>

<P>The Board is hereby authorized to contract with or otherwise arrange to obtain the insurance 
coverage required hereunder through Declarant or its affiliates and to reimburse the Person so providing 
or arranging the insurance coverage for the cost thereof, and Declarant or its affiliates shall be 
authorized, but not obligated, to purchase such insurance coverage for the benefit of the Association and 
the Owners upon Declarant or its affiliate, as the case may be, and the Association agreeing upon the 
terms and conditions applicable to reimbursement by the Association for costs incurred by Declarant or 
its affiliate, as the case may be, in obtaining such coverage. Notwithstanding anything contained in this 
Declaration to the contrary, the Board shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this Article 
if the Board has contracted for or otherwise arranged to obtain the required insurance coverage through 
Declarant or its affiliates. </P>
<P>Premiums for all insurance shall be Common Expenses of the Association. The policies may 
contain a reasonable deductible, and the amount thereof shall not be subtracted from the face amount of 
the policy in determining whether the insurance at least equals the full replacement cost. 
All such insurance coverage obtained by the Board of Directors shall be written in the name of 
the Association, as trustee for the respective parties which may be benefited by such insurance, as their 
interests may appear. Such insurance shall be governed by the provisions hereinafter set forth: </P>

<ol type= "a">

<P><li> All policies shall be written with a company authorized to do business in Georgia.</li></P> 
<P><li>  All policies on the Common Property shall be for the benefit of the Association and its 

members. Any policies covering improvements on Lots shall be for the benefit of the Owners and their 
Mortgagees, as their interests may appear. </li></P> 
<P><li>  Exclusive authority to adjust losses under policies obtained by the Association shall be 
vested in the Association's Board of Directors; provided, however, no Mortgagee having an interest in 
such losses may be prohibited from participating in the settlement negotiations, if any, related thereto. </li></P> 
<P><li> In no event shall the insurance coverage obtained and maintained by the Association's 
Board of Directors hereunder be brought into contribution with insurance purchased by individual 
Owners, Occupants, or their Mortgagees, and the insurance carried by the Association shall be primary. </li></P> 
<P><li> All casualty insurance policies shall have an inflation guard endorsement and an agreed 
amount endorsement, if these are reasonably available, and all insurance policies shall be reviewed 
annually by one or more qualified Persons, at least one of whom must be in the real estate industry and 
familiar with construction in the county where the Community is located. </li></P> 
<P><li> The Association's Board of Directors shall be required to make every reasonable effort to 
secure insurance policies that will provide for the following: </li></P> 
<ul>
<ol type= "i">
<P><li> a waiver of subrogation by the insurer as to any claims against the Association's 
Board of Directors, its manager, the Owners and their respective tenants, servants, agents and guests; </li></P> 
<P><li> 	 a waiver by the insurer of its rights to repair and reconstruct instead of paying 
 cash; </li></P> 
<P><li> 	 a statement that no policy may be canceled, subjected to nonrenewal, invalidated 
 
or suspended on account of any one or more individual Owners; </li></P> 

 
<p><center><h1>-11-</h1></center></p>

<P><li>  a statement that no policy may be canceled, subjected to nonrenewal, invalidated 
or suspended on account of any defect or the conduct of any director, officer or employee of the 
Association or its duly authorized manager without prior demand in writing delivered to the Association 
to cure the defect or to cease the conduct and the allowance of a reasonable time thereafter within which 
a cure may be effected by the Association, its manager, any Owner or Mortgagee; </li></P> 
<P><li>  a statement that any "other insurance" clause in any policy exclude individual 
Owners' policies from consideration; and </li></P> 
<P><li>  a statement that no policy may be canceled, subjected to nonrenewal, or 
substantially modified without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Association. 
In addition to other insurance coverage required by this Section, the Board shall obtain workers 
compensation insurance (if and to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of applicable law) and, 
if available at reasonable cost, as determined in the sole discretion of the Board, a fidelity bond or 
employees dishonesty coverage covering directors, officers, employees and other Persons handling or 
responsible for the Association's funds. The amount of a fidelity bond or employees dishonesty 
coverage, if obtained, shall be determined in the directors' best business judgment, but if reasonably 
available, shall not be less than three (3) months assessments plus a reasonable amount to cover all or a 
reasonable portion of the reserve funds in the custody of the Association at any time during the term of 
the bond. Such fidelity bond or employee dishonesty coverage, if obtained, shall contain a waiver of all 
defenses based upon the exclusion of Persons serving without compensation and shall not be subject to 
cancellation, nonrenewal or substantial modification without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice 
to the Association. The Association shall also obtain construction code endorsements, steam boiler 
coverage and flood insurance, if and to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of The Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or the Federal National Mortgage Association, the U.S. Department 
of Veterans Affairs ("VAN) or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD). </li></P> 

<P>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Damage and Destruction.</u> 
<ol type= "a">
<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> In General. </u>Immediately after the damage or destruction by fire 
or other casualty to all 
or any portion of any improvement covered by insurance written in the name of the Association, the 
Board of Directors or its duly authorized agent shall proceed with the filing and adjustment of all claims 
arising under such insurance and obtain reliable and detailed estimates of the cost of repair or 
reconstruction of the damaged or destroyed property. Repair or reconstruction, as used in this Section, 
means repairing or restoring the property to substantially the same condition and location that existed 
prior to the fire or other casualty, allowing for any changes or improvements necessary to comply with 
applicable building codes.</li></p> 
<p><li> Repair and Reconstruction. Any damage or destruction to property required to be 
covered by insurance written in the name of the Association shall be repaired or reconstructed unless, 
within sixty (60) days after the casualty, at least eighty percent (80%) of the Total Association Vote, 
including the Owner or Owners of any damaged Lot or Lots otherwise agree. If for any reason either the 
amount of the insurance proceeds to be paid as a result of such damage or destruction, or reliable and 
detailed estimates of the cost of repair or reconstruction, or both, are not made available to the 
Association within such period, then the period shall be extended until such information shall be made 
available; provided, however, such extension shall not exceed sixty (60) days. No Mortgagee shall have 
the right to participate in the determination of whether damage or destruction shall be repaired or 
reconstructed </LI></P>

<p><center><h1>-12-</h1></center></p>

<p>If the damage or destruction for which the insurance proceeds are paid is to be repaired or 
reconstructed and such proceeds are not sufficient to defray the cost thereof, the Board of Directors shall, 
without the necessity of a vote of the Association's members, levy a special assessment against all 
Owners in proportion to the number of Lots owned by such Owners. Additional assessments may be 
made in like manner at any time during or following the completion of any repair or reconstruction. If 
the funds available from insurance exceed the costs of repair or reconstruction or if the improvements are 
not repaired or reconstructed, such excess shall be deposited to the benefit of the Association. </P>
<p>In the event that it should be determined in the manner described above that the damage or 
destruction shall not be repaired or reconstructed and no alternative improvements are authorized, then 
and in that event the property shall be restored to its natural state and maintained as an undeveloped 
portion of the Community by the Association in a neat and attractive condition. </P>
<p>Section 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Insurance Deductible. </U>The deductible for any casualty insurance policy carried 
by the Association shall, in the event of damage or destruction, be allocated among the Persons who 
would be responsible for such loss in the absence of insurance. If the loss affects more than one (1) Lot 
or a Lot and the Common Property, the cost of the deductible may be apportioned and assessed equitably 
by the Board among the parties suffering loss in accordance with the total costs of repair, unless the 
insurance policy provides that the deductible will apply to each Lot separately. If any Owner fails to pay 
the deductible when required hereunder, the Association can pay the deductible and assess the cost to any 
such Owner pursuant to Article V, Section 8 of this Declaration. </p>

<p>Section 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Casualty Losses. </u>In the event of damage to or destruction of all or any part of the 
Community as a result of fire or other casualty, unless eighty percent (80%) of the Total Association Vote 
other than Declarant, including the Owner or Owners of the damaged Lot or Lots, and the Declarant vote 
not to proceed with the reconstruction and repair of the structure, the Board of Directors or its duly 
authorized agent shall arrange for and supervise the prompt repair and restoration of the structure. The 
Declarant's vote is required hereunder during the Declarant Control Period. In the event of substantial 
damage or destruction, each institutional holder of a first Mortgage shall be entitled to written notice of the 
damage, and nothing in these documents shall be construed to afford a priority to any Owner with respect to 
the distribution of proceeds to any such Lot. </P>

<ol type= "a">

<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Cost Estimates. </u>Immediately after a fire or other casualty causing damage to the 
Community, the Board of Directors shall obtain reliable and detailed estimates of the cost of repairing and 
restoring the structures (including any damaged Lot) to substantially the condition which existed before 
such casualty, allowing for any changes or improvements necessitated by changes in applicable building 
codes. Such costs may also include professional fees and premiums for such bonds as the Board of 
Directors determines to be necessary. </P></Li>
<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Source and Allocation of Proceeds. </u>If the proceeds of insurance are not sufficient 
to defray the estimated costs of reconstruction and repair, as determined by the Board of Directors, or if at 
any time during the reconstruction and repair or upon completion of reconstruction and repair the funds for 
the payment of the costs thereof are insufficient, a special assessment shall be made against all of the 
Owners without the necessity of a vote of the members or compliance with Article V, Section 4 above. If 
after repair and reconstruction is completed there is a surplus of funds, such funds shall be common funds of 
the Association to be used as directed by the Board of Directors. </P></li>

<p><center><h1>-13-</h1></center></p>

<P><li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Plans and Specifications. </u>Any such reconstruction or repair shall be substantially 
in accordance with the plans and specifications under which the Community was originally constructed, 
except where changes are necessary to comply with current applicable building codes or where 
improvements not in accordance with the original plans and specifications are approved by the Board of 
Directors. To the extent insurance proceeds are available, the Association may reconstruct or repair owner 
improvements damaged as a result of fire or other casualty. </P></U>
<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Encroachments. </U>Encroachments upon or in favor of Lots that may be created as a 
result of such reconstruction or repair shall not constitute a claim or basis for any proceeding or action by 
the Owner upon whose property such encroachment exists, provided that such reconstruction was 
substantially in accordance with the architectural plans under which the Community was originally 
constructed. Such encroachments shall be allowed to continue in existence for so long as the reconstructed 
building shall stand. </li></P>
<P><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Construction Fund. </U>The net proceeds of the insurance collected on account of a 
casualty and the funds collected by the Association from assessments against the Owners on account of such 
casualty shall constitute a construction fund which shall be disbursed in payment of the cost of 
reconstruction and repair in the manner set forth in this Article VI, Section 4(e) to be disbursed by the 
Association in appropriate progress payment to such contractor(s), supplier(s), and personnel performing the 
work or supplying materials or services for the repair and reconstruction of the buildings as are designated 
by the Board of Directors. </li></P>

<p>Section 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>General. </U>Except as otherwise provided herein, no Owner, Occupant, or any other 
Person may, without first obtaining the written approval of the Architectural Control Committee ("ACC"): 
<uL>
<ol type= "a">

	<li> <P>construct any improvement on a Lot; </li>
	
<p><center><h1>-14-</h1></center></p>


<P><li> make any exterior change, alteration, modification or construction on a Lot 


(including, but not limited to, painting) or the Exclusive Common Property (including, hut not limited to, 
regrading, altering or replacing any mailbox (if any), and making any landscaping modifications); and </p></li>
<p><li>erect, place or post any object, sign, clothesline, playground equipment, basketball 
hoops, light, storm door or window, artificial vegetation, exterior sculpture, fountains, flags or other thing 
on the Exclusive Common Property, on the Lot, in any windows of the residence on such Lot, or on any 
Common Property. </p>
<P>The standard for approval of such improvements shall include, but not he limited to: (1) aesthetic 
considerations, (2) materials to he used, (3) compliance with the Community-Wide Standard, this 
Declaration, or the design standards which may be adopted by the Board or ACC, (4) harmony with the 
external design of the existing buildings, Lots and structures, and the location in relation to surrounding 
structures and topography, and (5) any other matters deemed to be relevant or appropriate by the Board or 
ACC. </P>
<P>Applications for approval of any such architectural modification shall be in writing and shall 
provide such information as the ACC may reasonably require. The ACC or its designated representative 
(including, but not limited to the architect of the original floor plans of a residence located on a Lot) shall be 
the sole arbiter of such application and may withhold approval for any reason, including purely aesthetic 
considerations, and it shall be entitled to stop any construction which is not in conformance with approved 
plans. The Board or the ACC may publish written architectural standards for exterior and Common 
Property alterations or additions, and any request in substantial compliance therewith shall be approved; 
provided, however, each such requested change shall be in harmony with the external design of the existing 
buildings and Lots and the location in relation to surrounding structures and topography of the vicinity. </P>
<P>The ACC or the Board, subject to this Article VIII, Section 1, may allow such encroachments on the 
Common Property as it deems acceptable. </P>
<P>If the ACC or its designated representative fails to approve or to disapprove such application within 
forty-five (45) days after the application and such information as the ACC may reasonably require shall 
have been submitted, its approval will not be required and this Section will be deemed complied with; 
provided, however, even if the requirements of this Section are satisfied, nothing herein shall authorize 
anyone to construct or maintain any structure or improvement that is otherwise in violation of the 
Declaration, the Bylaws, the design standards, the Association's rules and regulations, or applicable zoning 
ordinances.</P> 
<P>This Article shall not apply to the activity of the Declarant, nor to constructions or improvements or 
modifications to the Common Property by or on behalf of the Association. </P>
<P>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Architectural Control Committee. </U>
<ol type= "a">
<P><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> During Declarant Control. </U>During the Declarant Control Period, there shall be no 
Architectural Control Committee ("ACC') and all encroachments onto the Common Property and any 
exterior change, alteration or construction (including painting any improvement and landscaping) and any 
erection, placement or posting of any object, sign, light, flag or thing on any Lot or in any window (except 
window treatments as provided herein), must receive the prior written approval of the Declarant. Granting

<p><li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>After Declarant Control. </U>After expiration of the Declarant Control Period, the 
ACC shall consist of the Board unless the Board delegates to other Persons the authority to serve on the 
ACC. The ACC shall have the authority to select and employ professional consultants to assist it in 
discharging its duties, the cost of such consultants to be paid by the Owner of any Lot for which plans and 
specifications have been submitted for approval. The Owner of any such Lot shall be responsible for paying 
the full costs of each review, whether or not submitted plans and specifications are approved by the ACC, 
and the ACC may require payment of all such costs prior to approval of plans and specifications. The 
Association, by and through the ACC, also may charge reasonable fees to cover the cost of review or 
inspections performed hereunder, and any such fees shall be published in the design standards. </P>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the ACC shall have the authority to select and 
employ professional consultants to assist it in discharging its duties, the cost of such consultants to be paid 
by the Owner of any Lot for which plans and specifications have been submitted for approval. The Owner 
of any such Lot shall be responsible for paying the full costs of each review, whether or not submitted plans 
and specifications are approved by the ACC, and the ACC may require payment of all such costs prior to 
approval of plans and specifications. The ACC also may charge reasonable fees to cover the cost of review 
or inspections performed hereunder, and any such fees shall be published in the design standards for the 
Community. 
<P>Section 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Alterations to the Interior of a Residence Located on a Lot. </U>Except as provided 
herein, no Owner or Occupant shall make any changes, alterations, modification or construction to the 
interior of a residence located on a Lot that involves connecting to a pipe, line, conduit and/or other 
apparatus for access to common utilities, or places an excessive load on any structural or load bearing 
portions of a residence or otherwise negatively impacts the structural integrity of the residence and any 
adjoining residences without first obtaining the prior written approval of the ACC. Such approval shall not 
be granted by the ACC unless the Owner has presented to the ACC a report and/or drawing prepared by a 
licensed structural engineer showing that compensating measures will be taken to ensure the structural 
integrity of the residence and any adjoining residences. All building code requirements must be complied 
with and necessary permits and approvals for the proposed change, alteration, modification or construction 
shall be secured by an Owner at Owner's sole expense. </P>
<P>Section 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Condition of Approval. </u>As a condition of approval for a requested architectural 
change, modification, addition, or alteration, an Owner, on behalf of himself or herself and his or her 
successors-in-interest, shall assume all responsibilities for maintenance, repair, replacement and insurance 
to and on such change, modification, addition, or alteration. In the discretion of the Board or the ACC, an 
Owner may be made to verify such condition of approval by written instrument in recordable form 
acknowledged by such Owner on behalf of himself or herself and all successors-in-interest.</p> 
<P>Section 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Limitation of Liability. </U>Review and approval of any application pursuant to this 
Article VIII may be made on any basis, including solely the basis of aesthetic considerations, and neither the 
Board nor the ACC shall bear any responsibility for ensuring the design, quality, structural integrity or 
soundness of approved construction or modifications, nor for ensuring compliance with building codes, 
zoning regulations and other governmental requirements. Neither the Association, the Board, the ACC, or 
member of any of the foregoing shall be held liable for any injury, damages or loss arising out of the 
manner, design or quality of approved construction on or modifications to any Lot. </p>
<P>Section 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>No Waiver of Future Approvals. </u>
Each Owner acknowledges that the members of 
the Board and the ACC will change from time to time and that interpretation, application and enforcement 
of the architectural standards may vary accordingly. The approval of either the Board or the ACC of any 
proposals, plans and specifications or drawings for any work done or proposed, or in connection with any 
other matter requiring the approval of the Board or the ACC, shall not constitute a waiver of any right to 
withhold approval or consent as to any similar proposals, plans and specifications, drawings, or matters 
whatever subsequently or additionally submitted for approval or consent. </p>


<P><center><h1>-16-</h1></center></p>


<p>Section 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Enforcement. </U>Any construction, alteration, or other work done in violation of this 
Article VIII, the Declaration, the Bylaws or the design standards shall be deemed to be nonconforming. 
Upon written request from the Board, Owners shall, at their own cost and expense, remove such 
construction, alteration, or other work and shall restore the property to substantially the same condition as 
existed prior to the construction, alteration, or other work. Should an Owner fail to remove and restore as 
required hereunder, the Board or its designees shall have the right to enter the property, remove the violation 
and restore the property to substantially the same condition as existed prior to the construction, alteration or 
other work. All costs thereof, including reasonable attorney's fees, may be assessed against the violating 
Lot. </P>
<P>In addition to the above, the Board shall have the authority and standing, on behalf of the 
Association, to impose reasonable fines and to pursue all legal and equitable remedies available to enforce 
the provisions of this Article VIII and its decisions or those of the ACC. Furthermore, the Board shall have 
the authority to record in the Cobb County land records notices of violation of the provisions of this Article 
VIII. </P>
<P>If any Owner or Occupant makes any exterior change, alteration, or construction (including 
landscaping) upon the Common Property in violation of this Article VIII, he or she does so at his or her sole 
risk and expense. The Board may require that the change, alteration or construction remain on the Common 
Property without reimbursement to the Owner or Occupant for any expense he or she may have incurred in 
making the change, alteration or construction. </P>
<p>Section 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Commencement of Construction.</U> All improvements approved by the ACC 
hereunder must be commenced within six (6) months from the date of approval. If not commenced within 
six (6)months from the date of such approval, then such approval shall be deemed revoked by the ACC, 
unless the ACC gives a written extension for commencing the work. All work approved by the ACC 
hereunder shall be completed in its entirety within three (3) months of commencement, unless otherwise 
agreed in writing by the ACC. The failure to timely complete work approved by the ACC in its entirety 
shall result in the automatic revocation of the approval by the ACC and upon occurrence of this event, the 
Owner shall remove all approved work and restore the Lot (and if applicable the Common Property) to the 
condition it was in prior to the approval being granted. </P>
<p>Section 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Approval of Contractors.</U> Landscapers and Architects. Any contractor, landscaper 
or architect, prior to performing any work on any Lot must first be approved by the Declarant or the ACC if 
there no longer is a Declarant, as to financial stability, building, landscaping or design experience and 
ability to build, landscape or design structures or grounds of the class and type of those which are to be built 
on the Community. Such approval may be granted or withheld in the sole and uncontrolled discretion of the 
ACC. Moreover, no person shall be approved as a contractor, landscaper or architect unless such Person 
obtains his income primarily from construction, landscaping or design of the type which the contractor, 
landscaper or architect is to perform upon the Lot, and has provided the Declarant or ACC, as applicable, 
evidence of public liability insurance and worker's compensation insurance. </P>

which must be complied with by all Owners and Occupants of Lots. These use restrictions may only be 
amended in the manner provided in Article XVI, Section 1, regarding amendment of this Declaration. In 
addition, the Board may, from time to time, without consent of the Owners, adopt, modify, or delete rules 
and regulations applicable to the Community. These rules shall be distributed to all Owners prior to the date 
that they are to become effective and after distribution shall be binding upon all Owners and Occupants of 
Lots until and unless overruled, canceled, or modified, by the Declarant (during the Declarant Control 
Period) or by a Majority of the Total Association Vote, at a regular or special meeting. Notwithstanding 
the above, during the Declarant Control Period, no rules and regulations which affect the Declarant may be 
adopted, modified, or deleted without the written consent of the Declarant. </P>
<p>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Residential Use. </u>Each Lot shall be used for residential purposes only, and no trade

<ol type= "a">

<P><li> the existence or operation of the business activity is not apparent or detectable by 
sight, sound, or smell from outside of the residence; </p></li>
<p><li> the business activity does not involve visitation of the residence by employees, 
clients, customers, suppliers or other business invitees in greater volume than would normally be expected 
for guest visitation to a residential residence without business activity; </p></li>
<p><li>the business activity conforms to all zoning requirements for the Community; </li></p>
<p><li>the business activity does not increase traffic in the Community in excess of what 

would normally be expected for residences in the Community without business activity (other than by 
deliveries by couriers, express mail carriers, parcel delivery services and other such similar delivery 
services); </li></p>
<li><p>the business activity does not increase the insurance premium paid by the 
Association or otherwise negatively affect the Association's ability to obtain insurance coverage; </p></li>
<p><li> the business activity is consistent with the residential character of the Community 
and does not constitute a nuisance or a hazardous or offensive use, or threaten the security or safety of other 
residents of the Community, and does not otherwise violate any other provision of the Association's legal 
instruments, as determined in the Board's discretion; and </p></li>
<p><li> the business activity does not result in a materially greater use of Common 
Property facilities or Association services. </p></li>

nonconsecutive, in any calendar year. This occupancy restriction shall not apply to require the removal of 
any person lawfully occupying a dwelling on the Effective Date hereof. Upon written application, the 
Board shall grant variances to this restriction to comply with provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments 
Act of 1988 or any amendments thereto. </P>
<P>If an Owner of a Lot is a corporation, partnership, trust or other legal entity not being a natural

nor shall anything be kept, parked or stored on any part of the Common Property without the prior written 
consent of the Association, except as specifically provided herein. </P>
<P>With the prior written approval of the Board of Directors, and subject to any restrictions imposed 
by the Board, an Owner or Owners may reserve portions of the Common Property for use for a period of 
time as set by the Board. The Board of Directors shall be permitted to charge such Owner or Owners 
reasonable fees, as determined in the Board's sole discretion, in connection with the reservation and use of 
any portion of the Common Property. Any such Owner or Owners who reserve a portion of the Common 
Property as provided herein shall assume, on behalf of himself/herself/themselves
and his/her/their guests, 
Occupants and family, all risks associated with the use of the Common Property and all liability for any 
damage or injury to any person or thing as a result of such use. The Association shall not be liable for any

against Owners or Occupants. If a fine is levied against an Occupant and is not timely paid, the fine may 
then be levied against the Owner. </P>
<P>Section 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Signs.</u>
Except as may be required by legal proceedings, no signs, advertising

<p><b>Section 1. </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Purpose.</b> </u>In order to preserve the character of the Community as predominantly owner-occupied, the leasing of a residence located on a Lot shall be governed by the restrictions set forth in this Article X. Except as provided herein, the leasing of a residence located on a Lot shall be prohibited. "Leasing," for the purposes of this Declaration, is defined as regular, exclusive occupancy of a residence located on a Lot by any Person other than the Owner; provided, however, for the purposes of this Declaration, Leasing shall not include the occupancy of a residence located on a Lot by the child or parent of an Owner. For purposes hereof, occupancy by a roommate of an Owner who occupies the residence as such Owner's primary residence shall not constitute Leasing hereunder. The Board shall have the power to make and enforce reasonable rules and regulations and to fine, in accordance with the Declaration and Bylaws, in order to enforce the provisions of this Article X. </P>

<P><b>Section 2. </b> &nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Leasing Provisions.</b></U> Leasing of a residence located on a Lot shall be governed by the following provisions:

<p><center><h1>-25-</h1></center></p>

<ul>
<ol type= "a">
<li>	&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>General.</b></U> An Owner desiring to lease his or her residence may do so only if the Owner has applied for and received from the Board of ,Directors either a "Leasing Permit" or a "Hardship Leasing Permit." Such a permit, upon its issuance, will allow an Owner to lease his or her residence provided that such Leasing is in strict accordance with the terms of the permit and this Article X. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to establish conditions as to the duration and use of such permits consistent with this Article X. All Leasing Permits and Hardship Leasing Permits shall be valid only as to a specific Owner and such Owner's residence and shall not be transferable between either residences or Lot Owners, but shall be transferable to successors in title to the same Lot. </li>
<p>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b> Leasing Permits.</B></u> An Owner's request for a Leasing Permit shall be approved if current, outstanding Leasing Permits have not been issued for more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of Lots (excluding Lots owned by the Declarant) in the Community. A Leasing Permit shall be automatically revoked upon the happening of any of the following events: (1) the sale or transfer of the Lot to a third party (excluding sales or transfers to (a) an Owner's spouse, (b) a person cohabitating with the Owner, and (c) a corporation, partnership, company, or legal entity in which the Owner is a principal); (2) the failure of an Owner to lease his or her residence within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Leasing Permit having been issued; or (3) the failure of an Owner to have his or her residence leased for any consecutive one hundred eighty (180) day period thereafter. If current Leasing Permits have been issued for more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of Lots (excluding Lots owned by the Declarant), no additional Leasing Permits shall be issued (except for Hardship Leasing Permits) until the number of outstanding current Leasing Permits falls below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of Lots (excluding Lots owned by the Declarant) in the Community. Owners who have been denied a Leasing Permit shall automatically be placed on a waiting list for a Leasing Permit and shall be issued the same if they so desire when the number of current outstanding Leasing Permits issued falls to twenty-five percent (25%) or less of the total number of Lots (excluding Lots owned by the Declarant) in the Community. The issuance of a Hardship Leasing Permit to an Owner shall not cause the Owner to be removed from the waiting list for a Leasing Permit.</li>
</p><P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><B>Hardship Leasing Permits.</B></u> If the failure to lease will result in a hardship, the Owner may seek to lease on a hardship basis by applying to the Board of Directors for a Hardship Leasing Permit. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to issue or deny requests for Hardship Leasing Permits in its discretion after considering the following factors: (1) the nature, degree, and likely duration of the hardship, (2) the harm, if any, which will result to the Community if the permit is approved, (3) the number of Hardship Leasing Permits which have been issued to other Owners, (4) the Owner's ability to cure the hardship, and (5) whether previous Hardship Leasing Permits have been issued to the Owner. A "hardship" as described herein shall include, but not be limited to the following situations: (1) an Owner must relocate his or her residence outside the greater Atlanta metropolitan area and cannot, within six (6) months from the date that the residence was placed on the market, sell the residence except at a price below the current appraised market value, after having made reasonable efforts to do so; (2) where the Owner dies and the residence is being administered by his or her estate; and (3) the Owner takes a leave of absence or temporarily relocates and intends to return to reside in the residence. Hardship Leasing Permits shall be valid for a term not to exceed one (1) year. Owners may apply for additional Hardship Leasing Permits. Hardship Leasing Permits shall be automatically revoked if during the term of the permit, the Owner is approved for and receives a Leasing Permit.</li>
</p><P>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> <B>Leasing Provisions.</B></u> Leasing which is authorized, pursuant to permit, hereunder shall be governed by the following provisions:

In the event a lease is disapproved, the Board shall notify the Owner of the requisite action to he taken in order to bring the lease in compliance with the Declaration and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto.</li>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>	<b>General. </B></u>A residence located on a Lot may be leased only in its entirety; no fraction or portion may be leased without prior written Board approval. All leases shall be in writing and in a form approved by the Board prior to the effective date of the lease. The Board may maintain and, upon request, provide a form that is deemed acceptable. There shall be no subleasing of a residence or assignment of leases without prior written Board approval. All leases must be for an initial term of not less than one (1) year, except with written Board approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld in cases of undue hardship. Within ten (10) days after executing a lease agreement for the lease of a residence, the Owner shall provide the Board with a copy of the lease and the name of the lessee and all other people occupying the residence. The Owner must provide the lessee copies of the Declaration, Bylaws, and the rules and regulations. Nothing herein shall be construed as giving the Association the right to approve or disapprove a proposed lessee; the Board's approval or disapproval shall be limited to the form of the proposed lease.</li>
</p><P>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>	<b>Liability for Assessments, Use of Common Elements. and Compliance with Declaration, Bylaws, and Rules and Regulations. </B></u>Each Owner covenants and agrees that any lease of a residence located on a Lot shall contain the following language and agrees that if such language is not expressly contained therein, then such language shall be incorporated into the lease by existence of this covenant, and the lessee, by occupancy of the residence, agrees to the applicability of this covenant and incorporation of the following language into the lease:</li>

The Owner shall cause all Occupants of his or her residence to comply with the Declaration, Bylaws, and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, and shall be responsible for all violations by such Occupants, notwithstanding the fact that such Occupants of the residence are fully
liable and may be sanctioned for any such violation. If the lessee, or a person living with the lessee, violates the Declaration, Bylaws, or a rule or regulation for which a fine is imposed, notice of the violation shall be given to the Owner and the lessee, and such fine may be assessed against the lessee in accordance with Article V of the Bylaws. If the fine is not paid by the lessee within the time period set by the Board, the Owner shall pay the fine upon notice from the Association of the lessee's failure to pay the fine. Unpaid fines shall constitute a lien against the Lot. </p>

<p>Any violation of the Declaration, Bylaws, or rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto by the lessee, any Occupant, or any guest of lessee, is deemed to be a default under the terms of the lease and authorizes the Owner to terminate the lease without liability and to evict the lessee in accordance with Georgia law. The Owner hereby delegates and assigns to the Association, acting through the Board, the power and authority of enforcement against the lessee for breaches resulting from the violation of the Declaration, Bylaws, and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, including the power and authority to evict the lessee as attorney-in-fact on behalf and for the benefit of the Owner, in accordance with the terms hereof. If the Association proceeds to evict the lessee, any costs, including reasonable attorney's fees actually incurred and court costs associated with the eviction shall be an assessment and lien against the Lot.</P></li>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>	<b>Use of Common Elements. </B></u>The Owner transfers and assigns to the lessee, for the term of the lease, any and all rights and privileges that the Owner has to use the Common Elements, including but not limited to, the use of any and all recreational facilities and other amenities.</li>
</p><P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>	<b>Liability for Assessments. </B></U>When an Owner who is leasing his or her residence fails to pay any annual or special assessment or any other charge for a period of more than thirty (30) days after it is due and payable, then the delinquent Owner hereby consents to the assignment of any rent received from the lessee during the period of delinquency, and, upon request by the Board, lessee shall pay to the Association all unpaid annual and special assessments and other charges payable during and prior to the term of the lease and any other period of occupancy by lessee. However, lessee need not make such payments to the Association in excess of, or prior to the due dates for, monthly rental payments unpaid at the time of the Board's request. All such payments made by lessee shall reduce, by the same amount, lessee's obligation to make monthly rental payments to lessor. If lessee fails to comply with the Board's request to pay assessments or other charges, lessee shall pay to the Association all amounts authorized under the Declaration as if lessee were an Owner. The above provision shall not be construed to release the Owner from any obligation, including the obligation for assessments, for which he or she would otherwise be responsible.</li>
</p><P>
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Applicability of Article X.</b> </u>Notwithstanding the above, this Article X shall not apply to any leasing transaction entered into by the Declarant (regardless of whether said lease is entered into prior to or after the expiration of the Declarant Control Period), the Association, or the holder of any first Mortgage on a Lot who becomes the Owner of a Lot through foreclosure or any other means pursuant to the satisfaction of the indebtedness secured by such Mortgage. Such parties shall be permitted to lease a residence located on a Lot without first obtaining a permit in accordance with this Article X, and such residence located on a Lot shall not considered as being leased in determining the maximum number of residences that may be leased in accordance with this Article X.

<h2>Maintenance </h2></center></a>

<center><a href= "#home"><font face= "times">Table of Contents</font></a></Center>





<P>Section 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Association's Responsibility. </U>The Association shall maintain and keep in good 
repair the Area of Common Responsibility, which shall be deemed to include the following: 
<ol type= "a">
<P><LI> maintenance, repair, and replacement subject to any insurance then in effect, of the 
Common Property, including, but not limited to, all Exclusive Common Property as defined herein, and all 
Common Property landscaping and grassy areas, all roads, sidewalks and other concrete and paved areas not 
included in a Lot, the entry feature, two (2) water pressure pumps, park areas, and all retaining walls; </P></LI>
<P><LI>maintenance and repair of all water and sewer pipes or facilities which serve more 
than one (1) Lot to the extent that such pipes and facilities are not maintained by the Owner as set forth 
below or by public, private, or municipal utility companies; and </p></LI>
<P><LI>maintenance and repair of the following portions of the Lots: </p></li>
<UL>
<ol type= "i">
<P><LI> all roof surfaces, and portions of roofs above the roof joists, including the 
plywood underdecking, sheathing, if any, roof shingles, flashing, all gutters and all downspouts; </p></li>
<P><li> all exterior building surfaces (including all brick, stone, siding and 
columns, if any, and all wrought iron and metal surfaces); and </li></p>
<p><li>all exterior painting (including painting of all shutters, trim and columns, if 
any, and all wrought iron and metal surfaces). </li></p>

<P>The two (2) above-referenced water pressure pumps run on electrical current which do not have a 
backup source of energy if electrical service is interrupted. While there is no formal maintenance schedule 
for maintaining the water pressure pumps, the seals on the pumps should be checked at least annually. 
There is a limited life span on the water pressure pumps. It is estimated that the water pressure pumps will 
need to be replaced approximately every ten (10) years if maintained in proper working order. Said water 
pressure pumps were installed by Mayland Southern Pump & Process, Inc., whose contact address and 
telephone number as of the recording of this Declaration was 1461 Ventura Drive, Cummning, Georgia 
30044, (770) 886-6886. </p>
<p>Specifically excluded from such Area of Common Responsibility shall be the following: (1) 
HVAC or similar equipment located outside the residence; (2) all doors (including screen, storm and garage 
doors), hinges, frames, locks, and hardware which are part of the entry system except the Association shall 
paint the exterior portion of the front door and the garage doors; (3) hoses, vents or water spigots contained 
in exterior walls of the residence; (4) lighting fixtures pertaining to a particular residence and being located 
outside an entryway or in a garage; (5) window screens, frames, hardware and glass; (6) foundations and 
footings including waterproofing above and below grade; (7) pipes which serve only one Lot located within 
the Lot's boundaries or, if located in the front yard on the Lot, outside the Lot's boundaries, the portion of 
the pipe from the cutoff valve serving the Lot to the Lot itself, including the cutoff valve serving the Lot; (8) 
gas lanterns; (9) the replacement of any dead trees located in natural areas; (10) decks assigned as Exclusive 
Common Property in accordance with this Declaration, and (11) all improvements made by any Owner or 
Occupant. The Association shall replace dead trees located in landscaped areas on the Lot. </P>

<p><center><h1>-30-</h1></center></p>

<P>Upon resolution of the Board of Directors and approval of a Majority of the members present or 
represented by proxy at a duly constituted meeting of the members, the Association may assume 
responsibility for providing additional exterior maintenance upon Lot improvements. The Association shall 
have the right, but not the obligation, to maintain other property not owned by the Association where the 
Board has determined that such maintenance would benefit all Owners. </p>




<p>The foregoing maintenance shall be performed consistent with the Community-Wide Standard. </P>

<p>The Association shall not be liable for injury or damage to person or property caused by the 
elements or by the Owner of any Lot, or any other Person, or resulting from any utility, rain, snow or ice 
which may leak or flow from any portion of the Area of Common Responsibility or from any pipe, drain, 
conduit, appliance or equipment which the Association is responsible to maintain hereunder. The 
Association shall not be liable to the Owner of any Lot or such Owner's Occupant, guest, or family, for loss 
or damage, by theft or otherwise, of any property which may be stored in or upon any of the Common 
Property. The Association shall not be liable to any Owner, or any Owner's Occupant, guest or family for 
any damage or injury caused in whole or in part by the Association's failure to discharge its responsibilities 
under this Article XII, Section 1 where such damage or injury is not a foreseeable, natural result of the 
Association's failure to discharge its responsibilities. No diminution or abatement of assessments shall be 
claimed or allowed by reason of any alleged failure of the Association to take some action or perform some 
function required to be taken or performed by the Association under this Declaration, or for inconvenience 
or discomfort arising from the making of repairs or improvements which are the responsibility of the 
Association, or from any action taken by the Association to comply with any law, ordinance, or with any 
order to directive of any municipal or other governmental authority. </P>
<P>The Association shall repair incidental damage to any Lot resulting from performance of work 
which is the responsibility of the Association. Repairs to improvements on a Lot shall be completed only to 
the extent of being "paint-ready." Such repair and subsequent cleaning shall be performed based on a 
reasonableness standard and at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. In performing its 
responsibilities hereunder, the Association shall have the authority to delegate such Persons, firms or 
corporations of its choice, such duties as are approved by the Board of Directors. </P>
<P>In the event that the Association determines that the need for maintenance, repair, or replacement, 
which is the responsibility of the Association, is caused through the willful or negligent act of an Owner, his 
or her family, guests, lessees, or invitees, and is not completely covered or paid for by insurance, then the 
Association may perform the maintenance, repair or replacement at the expense of the Owner, and all costs 
shall be specifically assessed against the Owner and shall be added to and become a pm of the assessment 
obligation of the Owner and shall become a lien against the Lot. </P>
<P>In performing its responsibility hereunder, the Association shall have the authority to delegate to 
such Persons, firm or corporations of its choice, such duties as are approved by the Board of Directors.</P>
 
<p>Section 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Owner's Responsibility. </U>Except as provided in Article XU, Section 1 above, all 
maintenance of the Lot shall be the responsibility of the Owner thereof. In addition, the Owner shall 
maintain all pipes, lines, ducts, conduits, or other apparatus which serve only the Lot located within the 
Lot's boundaries or, if located outside the Lot's boundaries, the portion of the pipe from the cutoff valve 
serving the Lot (including all gas, electricity, water, sewer and air conditioning pipes, lines, ducts, conduits 
and other apparatus and the cut off valves for same serving only the Lot). The Owner shall also maintain 
and repair all doors and windows on the Lot, except for the painting of the front door and the garage doors, 
which shall be the Association's responsibility. Such maintenance shall be performed consistent with this 
</P>
<P><center><h1>-31-</h1></center></p>

<P>Declaration and the Community-Wide Standard established pursuant hereto. Any maintenance which 
involves an exterior change, including, without limitation, repainting of the exterior of improvements in a 
different color, shall require prior approval of the Board or its designee pursuant to Article VIII of this 
Declaration. </P>
<P>Subject to the maintenance responsibilities herein provided, any maintenance or repair performed 
on or to the Common Property by an Owner or Occupant which is the responsibility of the Association 
hereunder (including, but not limited to landscaping of Common Property) shall be performed at the sole 
expense and risk of such Owner or Occupant, and the Owner or Occupant shall not be entitled to 
reimbursement from the Association even if the Association accepts the maintenance or repair. </P>
<P>Each Owner also shall be obligated: </P>
<ol type= "a">

<p><li>To perform his or her responsibility in such manner so as not to unreasonably 
disturb other persons in other Lots. </LI></P>
<p><li> To promptly report to the Association or its agent any defect or need for repairs, 
for which the Association is responsible. </li></P>
<P><li>Not to make any alterations in the portions of the Lot which are to be maintained 
by the Association or to remove any portion thereof or to make any additions thereto or do anything with 
respect to the exterior or interior of the Lot which would or might jeopardize or impair the safety or 
soundness of any Lot without first obtaining the written consent of the Board of Directors of the Association 
and all Owners and Mortgagees or the Lots affected, nor shall any Owner impair any easement without first 
obtaining written consent of the Association and of the Owner or Owners and their Mortgagees for whose 
benefit such easement exists. </li></p>
<P><li>To pay for the cost of repairing, replacing or cleaning up any item which is the 
responsibility of the Owner but which responsibility such Owner fails or refuses to discharge (which the 
Association shall have the right, but not the obligation, to do), or to pay for the cost of repairing, replacing 
or cleaning up any item which, although the responsibility of the Association, is necessitated by reason of 
the willful or negligent act of the Owner, his or her family, tenants or guests, with the cost thereof to be 
added to and become part of the Owner's next chargeable assessment. </p></li>
<p></li> To aid and assist the Association and its agents and employees as requested by the 
Association or its agents and employees, including, without limitation, removing, covering, shielding, or 
otherwise protecting any and all personal property in the areas to be maintained or repaired by the 
Association and its agents and employees in order for the Association and its agents and employees to 
conduct its maintenance and repair obligations on the Lots. The Association and its agents and employees 
shall not be liable for any injury, damage or loss to such personal property that is not removed, covered, 
shielded or otherwise protected by the Owner or Occupant of the Lot on which such personal property is 
located as requested by the Association or its agents and employees. </li></p>

<p>Section 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Failure to Maintain. </U>If the Board of Directors determines that: (a) any Owner has 
failed or refused to discharge properly his or her obligation with regard to the maintenance, repair or 
replacement of items of which he or she is responsible hereunder; or (b) that the need for maintenance, 
repair, or replacement which is in the Area of Common Responsibility is caused through the willful or 
negligent act of any Owner, his or her family, guests, lessees, or invitees, and is not covered or paid by 
insurance, in whole or in part, then, except in an emergency situation, the Association shall give the Owner </P>

<P><center><h1>-32-</h1></center></p>

<P>written notice of the Association's intent to provide necessary maintenance, repair, or replacement at the 
Owner's cost and expense. The notice shall set forth with reasonable particularity the maintenance, repair, 
or replacement deemed necessary by the Board of Directors. In the case of (a) above where the Owner has 
not discharged his or her responsibility, unless the Board of Directors determines that an emergency exists, 
the Owner shall have ten (10) days within which to complete maintenance or repair, or if the maintenance or 
repair is not capable of completion within such time period, to commence replacement or repair and 
diligently pursue completion thereof within ten (10) days. If the Board determines that an emergency exists 
or that an Owner has not complied with the demand given by the Association as herein provided, or that the 
need for maintenance or repair is in the Area of Common Responsibility as in the case of (b) above, then the 
Association may provide any such maintenance, repair or replacement at the Owner's sole cost and expense, 
and such costs shall he added to and become a part of the assessment to which such Owner is subject, shall 
become and be a lien against the Lot, and shall be collected as provided herein for the collection of 
assessments. <p>
<P>Section 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Measures Related to Insurance Coverage.</U> 
<ol type= "a">
<P><li>The Board of Directors, upon resolution, shall have the authority to require all or 
any Owner(s) to do any act or perform any work involving portions of the Community which are the 
maintenance responsibility of the Owner, which will, in the Board's sole discretion, decrease the possibility 
of fire or other damage to the Community, reduce the insurance premium paid by the Association for any 
insurance coverage or otherwise assist the Board in procuring or maintaining such insurance coverage. This 
authority shall include, but need not be limited to, requiring all Owners to turn off cutoff valves, which may 
now or hereafter be installed, during winter months for outside water spigots; requiring Owners to insulate 
pipes sufficiently or take other preventive measures to prevent freezing of water pipes; requiring Owners to 
install smoke detectors; requiring Owners to make improvements to the Owner's Lot; and such other 
measures as the Board may reasonably require so long as the cost of such work does not exceed Five 
Hundred and No1100 Dollars ($500.00) per lot in any twelve (12) month period. </p></li>
<p><li> In addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights the Association may have, 
if any Owner does not comply with any reasonable requirement made by the Board of Directors pursuant to 
Article XII, Section 4(a) above, the Association, upon fifteen (15) days written notice (during which period 
the Owner may perform the required act or work without further liability), may perform such required act or 
work at the Owner's sole cost and expense. Such cost shall be specifically assessed against the Owner and 
shall he added to and become a part of the assessment obligation of such Owner and shall become a lien 
against the Lot and shall be collected in the manner provided for collection of assessments. The Association 
shall have all rights necessary to implement the requirements mandated by the Board pursuant to this Article 
XII, Section 4(b), including, but not limited to, a right of entry during reasonable hours and after reasonable 
notice to the Owner or Occupant of the Lot, except that access may be had at any time without notice in an 
emergency situation. </li></p>
<P>Section 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Maintenance Standards and Interpretation. </u>The maintenance standards and the 
enforcement thereof and the interpretation of maintenance obligations under this Declaration may vary as 
the composition of the Board of Directors changes. These variances shall not constitute a waiver by the 
Board of the right to adopt and enforce maintenance standards under this Article XII. No decision or 
interpretation by the Board shall constitute a binding precedent with respect to subsequent decisions M 
interpretations of the Board. </p>
<p>Section 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Mold and/or Mildew. </u>Mold and/or mildew can grow in any portion of the 
Community that is exposed to elevated levels of moisture. The Association and each Owner agree to: (i) 
regularly inspect the parts of the Community that they respectively maintain, and which are visible and 
accessible without having to first remove building components or conduct invasive testing, for the 
existence of mold, mildew, and/or water intrusion (except when the water intrusion is part of the normal 
functioning of improvements and appliances such as showers, sinks, dishwashers, and other similar 
appliances and improvements) and/or water damage; (ii) upon discovery, immediately repair in a good 
and workmanlike condition the source of any water intrusion in the parts of the Community that they 
respectively maintain; (iii) remediate or replace, in accordance with current industry accepted methods, 
any building material located in the parts of the Community that they respectively maintain that has 
absorbed water or moisture as a result of water intrusion; and (iv) promptly and regularly remediate in 
accordance with current industry-accepted methods all mold and/or mildew discovered in the parts of the 
Community that they respectively maintain. In addition, except for routine housekeeping items and other 
de minimis matters, the Association agrees to notify the Owners, and each Owner agrees to notify the 
Association of the discovery of mold, mildew, and/or water intrusion and/or damage in the parts of the 
Community that they respectively maintain. Each Owner further agrees not to block or cover any of the 
heating, ventilation or air-conditioning ducts located in the Lot. </P>
<P>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Declarant shall have no obligation to perform 
any invasive testing or inspections, maintenance or repairs in accordance with this Article XII, Section 6, 
and shall not be held liable for any loss or damage caused by the failure of the Association or an Owner 
to perform their obligations herein. </P>
